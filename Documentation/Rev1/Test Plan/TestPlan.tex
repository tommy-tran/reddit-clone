\section {General Information}

\subsection {Purpose}
The purpose of this test plan is to verify that the program works as intended and was implemented correctly with the utmost confidence.

\subsection {Scope}
This test plan provides the basis for testing the Reddit-Clone program's functionality and that it properly mimics the functionality of the original open source project Reddit.  The program allows for users to post, discuss, and curate user created content.

The testing of Reddit-Clone means to cover the entirety of the project through black box, white box, manual, and automated tests.  This document is an outline of the testing methods including the testing tools to be utilized.

\section {Plan}
This section provides information on the Reddit-Clone project and the software testing plan. This plan is based off of the main functionality that exists as of the PoC as well as any additional functions outlined in the DevPlan.

\subsection {Software Description}
Reddit-Clone will allow authenticated users create posts, subreddits and comments as well as curate others' content through up-votes and down-votes.  The program is implemented in JavaScript with Angular 4 and Ionic 2 framework.

\subsection {Test Team}
The testing team for Reddit-Clone are all members of the AKT Development team: Alex Trudeau, Kathryn Kodama, Tommy Tran.  The lead tester will be Tommy Tran.

\subsection {Tools Used for Testing}
The dynamic testing will utilize the following tools.  Jasmine with Karma framework and Angular 4 testing packages will be used to dynamically test the JavaScript functionality of this project.  Through the use of Jasmine the testing team will carry out unit tests and end to end testing.

The HTML/CSS testing will be tested through static testing and observation on Unix, Windows, iOS, and Android environments.

\subsection {Testing Schedule}

Refer to the \href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/trudeaua/reddit-clone}{Gantt Chart} located in the project GitLab for the testing schema.   Testing is divided into the following categories within the Gantt chart: Account Management, Content Management, Navigation Methods.  Each testing category is assigned to a different member of the AKT development team and associated with a start date and end date.

\section{Tests for Proof of Concept}
Proof of concept testing will be focused on manual testing of the core functionalities of the project.  Proof of concept testing will focus on setting the stage for how the project will be tested going forward.  In terms of testing for the proof of concept, two major functionalities will be tested: account creation and management and creating content (posts, subreddits, comments).

\subsection{Account Creation and Management}
\subsection{Creating Content}



\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}
In order to ensure that the project has at least the core functions of Reddit, all functional types tests that we use can also be applied to the original Reddit application.

\section{Unit Testing Plan}
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}
The Jasmine test framework will be leveraged in order to unit test the functionality of the components and services. The core functions that will be tested are within the database service (database.service.ts) which handles almost all of the data transfer between the application and Firebase. These tests will mainly consist of structural tests to verify that the application receives proper information from the database. There will be no use of stubs or drivers in unit testing.
