\subsection {Naming Conventions and Terminology}

The naming conventions of this project have been agreed upon by the AKT development team.  Lower case Camel-Case will be closely followed when writing code.  Additionally, constants and enums will be identified with all capital naming conventions.  Each page and component of the code will follow standard ionic project naming conventions. For example, the homepage of the project will be named as follows: home.html, home.module.ts, home.scss, home.ts. 

\begin{table}[H]

User & A person using the application \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsection {Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

The original application is written in Python, an object oriented class-based programming language.  Since the AKT team is developing this project using JavaScript (still an object oriented language but not class-based) there is an assumption that all basic functionality can still be mimicked without relying on the same class-based system. \\ \\
This application is intended for use by the general public.  It is assumed that users will not require more than very basic knowledge of their device and web browser in order to access the application.  It is assumed that users of this application will have internet connectivity in order to access the application.\\ \\ 
If a user deletes their profile, the content they shared and contributed under that profile will remain on the application.

\section {Functional Requirements}

\subsection {The Scope of the Work}
The scope of this project is to mimic the basic functionality of Reddit with a new design. This core functions of this project are user authentication, creation of threads, comments, and the ability to rate content through ’up-votes’ and ’down-votes’. The project will be constructed using Node.js and JavaScript which any device with web browsing capabilities will be able to access.

\end{enumerate}}

\subsection {Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

\subsubsection{Ready-Made Products}
Since the application requires unique data management, it is not possible to purchase a solution.
\subsubsection{Products that can be copied}
The application is based off of the original Reddit so it is possible to observe the source code and try to mimic their solution.

\subsection {New Problems}
\subsubsection {Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation
Environment That May Inhibit the New Product}
Since the application is leveraging Firebase's free plan, if there are over 100 simultaneous connections or data transferred is over the allowed limit the application may not function correctly.
\subsubsection {Follow-Up Problems}
The application requires Firebase in order to function properly. If Firebase is shut down or offline there is nothing our developers can do about it.  Updates of Firebase can subsequently alter the compilation of the project and therefore the project must be updated accordingly.  

\subsection {Tasks}

\subsubsection{Project Planning}

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{\bf Project Planning }
\textcolor{red}{\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{10cm}X}
\toprule {\bf Task} & {\bf Projected Finish Date}\\
\midrule
User authentication & October 14, 2017 \\
Subreddit, Post and Comment functionality & October 16, 2017 \\
User profiles and subreddit/post sorting & November 13, 2017 \\
Additional functionalities & November 27, 2017 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}}
\end{table}

\textcolor{red}{A more detailed breakdown of the project can be viewed via the Gantt chart on the reddit-clone \href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/trudeaua/reddit-clone.git}{GitHub}}

\subsection {Risks}
As with any online open forum or discussion board, a health and safety risk associated with this project is cyber-bullying or online harassment. An additional health and safety risk associated with this application is strain on the eyes as it only operated through the screens of mobile devices or user's computers. There is also the case of copyright infringement or inappropriate content being posted. This will be up to the developers to prevent and curate while this application is in use.  The developers email will also be available for users to report specific cases of harassment or inappropriate use of the application. \\

\textcolor{red}{Risks to be tested for the proof of concept are user security.  It is critical to test that the project will protect the email and passwords of its' users.  Additionally, the proof of concept should test for FR1, FR2, FR3, FR5, FR6.  The remaining functional requirements will be implemented and tested after the initial proof of concept.  The appropriate corresponding non-functional requirements will be tested as the functional requirements are tested. }

\subsection {Costs}
There will be no external costs involved in the implementation of the project because of the free hosting service provided by Google Firebase. However, if there are too many users or posts a premium Firebase plan may need to be purchased. 

\subsection {User Documentation and Training}
The project will include a "Help" page which will instruct users upon creation of a log-in on how to create subreddits, posts, and upvote content.  The GUI will be easy enough to navigate that documentation will not be needed for users in order to browse content.
\subsection {Waiting Room}
The following requirements are not to be included in the initial product release.
\begin{itemize}
\item Curating and moderating content including but not limited to appointing moderators.  This would require additional developers.
\item Additional functionality including new sorting methods for content.
\item Restriction of inappropriate content including an option for users to report other users, comments, posts, and subreddits.
\item A messaging systems for users to have one-on-one conversations.
\end{itemize}

{\color{red}For the first proof of concept the following functionalities were ready to roll out:  user authentication, creating posts, subreddits, comments and up-voting and down-voting content. \\

Beyond the proof of concept (for the final demo) the following functionalities were added: user profile, sorting posts and subreddits, reddit-clone themes and deleting comments and posts.  }

\subsection {Ideas for Solutions}
Further insight on Firebase User authentication and security. 
Proper hierarchy, teamwork, and documentation of code with help to solve issues as they occur.
