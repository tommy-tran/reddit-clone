\section {Problem Statement}

\subsection{Introduction}

In today's society the internet plays a large role in the lives of the general public. Users can find out about current events as they are taking place through online news sources and connect with one another through social media platforms.  The goal of this project is to provide the general public with a \textbf{community based social news aggregator} where users can post information and take part in online discussions pertaining to a specific topic. 

\subsection{Importance}

With the current prominence of social media, it is important to provide users with a platform to both share and discuss information easily.  This project aids the \textbf{building of online communities} with the ability to discuss a wide range of topics from current events to specific interests or hobbies. \\
\newline
Additionally, one of the main functionalities of this project is the \textbf{ability to rate content} shared on the application through 'up-votes' and 'down-votes'.  The web content rating aspect of the project will allow \textbf{users the ability to curate the content shown} and provide feedback on one another's posts even if they have nothing new to add to the discussion.  

\subsection{Context}

The stakeholders for this application are the Developers (AKT Team), the end-users/general public, and the communities that exist both on the application and off the application that relate to specific 'subreddits' or threads.\\
\newline
The scope of this project is to mimic the basic functionality of Reddit with a new design.  The project will be built using Node.js and JavaScript which any device with web browsing capabilities will be able to access.
