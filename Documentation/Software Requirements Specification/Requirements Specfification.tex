\section {Project Drivers}

\subsection {Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of the project is to create a community based social news aggregator and message board. Users are able to rate posts based on their interest. Posts are then sorted from highest to lowest rated, essentially allowing for more interesting topics to be shown to a greater audience. In addition to viewing posts, users will be able to comment and discuss within each post.  This will facilitate the creation of and discussion within online communities.

\subsection {Stakeholders}

There are multiple stakeholders for this application as listed below.

\subsubsection* {The Customer/End Users}
\begin{itemize} 
\item \textbf{Application Registered Users: }The primary customers of this project are the application registered users. These are members of the general public who have an authenticated profile within the application and post and update shared content.
\item \textbf{General Public: }The secondary customers of this project are the general public users who browse the content without contributing and curating content.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection* {The Principals and Partners}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AKT Team: } The AKT Team are the developers of this project.  The team is involved in the creation and maintenance of the project.  In this case, the developers are the principal stakeholders as well as the producers.
    \item \textbf{Google Firebase: } Other producer stakeholders including Google Firebase as they are hosting the application and providing user authentication and database services.
\end{itemize}

\section {Project Constraints}

\subsection {Mandated Constraints}
\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}
\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Description:} The application shall operate on devices modern web browsers.
\\
\textbf{Rationale:} The users include anyone with a device that can operate a web browser.
\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The application shall be tested to be functional on web browsers across several devices.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Description:} The application shall operate only when the device is connected to the internet.
\\
\textbf{Rationale:} In order to submit content or participate in discussions, users require an internet connection.
\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The application shall not load content without an internet connection.
\end{tcolorbox}


\subsubsection {Implementation Environment of the Current System}
\begin{figure}[htp]

\caption{Implementation Environment Diagram}
\label{fig:env}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection {Partner or Collaborative Applications}
The application will leverage Google Firebase's services in order to handle user authentication, database communication and web server hosting.

\subsubsection {Off-the-Shelf Software}
The application requires that the user have a device that is able to connect to the internet and operate a web browser(Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera, etc). 

\subsubsection {Schedule Constraints}
The proof of concept demonstration application must be completed by October 16, 2017. \\
The application must be completed by December 6, 2017.  The development team can choose to maintain and update the project at their convenience after this date.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Reddit-Clone Naming Conventions} \label{tab:naming}
\end{table}

\subsection {Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

The original application is written in Python, an object oriented class-based programming language.  Since the AKT team is developing this project using JavaScript (still an object oriented language but not class-based) there is an assumption that all basic functionality can still be mimicked without relying on the same class-based system. \\ \\
This application is intended for use by the general public.  It is assumed that users will not require more than very basic knowledge of their device and web browser in order to access the application.  It is assumed that users of this application will have internet connectivity in order to access the application.\\ \\ 
If a user deletes their profile, the content they shared and contributed under that profile will remain on the application.

\section {Project Issues}

\subsection {Open Issues}
\textbf{Back end database management} \\
Authentication through Firebase has been completed but how the application manages data storing and data flow is still an issue.

\subsection {Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsubsection{Ready-Made Products}
Since the application requires unique data management, it is not possible to purchase a solution.
\subsubsection{Products that can be copied}
The application is based off of the original reddit so it is possible to observe the source code and try to mimic their solution.

\subsection {New Problems}
\subsubsection {Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation
Environment That May Inhibit the New Product}
Since the application is leveraging Firebase's free plan, if there are over 100 simultaneous connections or data transferred is over the allowed limit the application may not function correctly.
\subsubsection {Follow-Up Problems}
The application requires Firebase in order to function properly. If Firebase is shut down or offline there is nothing our developers can do about it.
\subsection {Tasks}
\subsubsection{Project Planning}
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{ |p{10cm}| p{6cm}| }
\hline
Task & Projected finish date \\
\hline
Subreddit, Post and Comment functionality & October 16, 2017 \\

User profiles, Thread sorting & November 13, 2017 \\
\hline
Extra features & November 27, 2017 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Project Planning Table} \label{tab:project planning}
\end{table}

\subsection {Risks}
As with any online open forum or discussion board, a health and safety risk associated with this project is cyber-bullying or online harassment. There is also the case of copyright infringement or inappropriate content being posted. This will be up to the developers to prevent and curate while this application is in use.  The developers email will also be available for users to report specific cases of harassment or inappropriate use of the application.

\subsection {Costs}
There will be no external costs involved in the implementation of the project because of the free hosting service provided by Google Firebase. However, if there are too many users or posts a premium Firebase plan may need to be purchased. 

\subsection {User Documentation and Training}
The project will include a "Help" page which will instruct users upon creation of a log-in on how to create subreddits, posts, and upvote content.

The GUI will be easy enough to navigate that documentation will not be needed for users in order to browse content.
\subsection {Waiting Room}
The following requirements are not to be included in the initial product release.
\begin{itemize}
\item Curating and moderating content including but not limited to appointing moderators.  This would require additional developers.
\item Additional functionality including new sorting methods for content.
\item Restriction of inappropriate content including an option for users to report other users, comments, posts, and subreddits.
\item A messaging systems for users to have one-on-one conversations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection {Ideas for Solutions}
Further insight on Firebase User authentication and security. 
Proper hierarchy, teamwork, and documentation fo code with help to solve issues as they occur.
